Which EvapoTranspiration do you mean?
------
Imaging something like this:<br>
In the last afternoon of a seven-day conference, there is one interesting presentation about EvapoTranspiration (ET). But I am so tired that I cannot pay attention to all of the talks. Thus, I will take a nap and ask my colleague on my right-side, "Paul, please wake me up when the ET topic starts. I am so tired. Is that okay?"<br>
Paul is a very series and kind person. His face is so confuse, and question back to me, "which ET do you mean?"<br>

Well, as a scientists, we gonna be series with this. Based on recent papers and books, the physical meaning and difference of terminologies below need to be noticed.
- ETo: Crop Reference EvapoTranspiration.
- ETc: Crop EvapoTranspiration.
- ETa: Actual EvapoTranspiration.
