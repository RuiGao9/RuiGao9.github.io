More than 20 students attended the class on April 15, 2025. Rui prepared two surveys for the participants. The first survey was conducted at the beginning of the session, aiming to gather information about the students’ skills and interests. This helped Rui better understand the young generation and tailor his approach accordingly. The second survey was administered at the end of the class to evaluate Rui’s effectiveness in communication, presentation, and leadership. A portion of the survey results can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sQx-iy8hCPcJqZwYrSHoo-C8KeYjIAY3/view?usp=drive_link).
