Which EvapoTranspiration do you mean?
------
Imagine this:<br>
It's the final afternoon of a marathon seven-day conference. My brain is 90% coffee, 10% sheer willpower. Suddenly, I spot an interesting talk on the schedule about EvapoTranspiration (ET). But let's be real — after seven days of non-stop technical jargon, my attention span has packed its bags and left the building.<br>
Exhausted, I lean over to my colleague on the right and whisper, "Po, please wake me up when the ET topic starts. I'm seriously fading. Deal?"<br>
Po — bless his soul — is a very serious and kind man. But now he looks completely bewildered, like I just asked him to solve quantum physics in his sleep. He squints at me, furrows his brow, and replies in complete confusion:<br>
**"Which ET do you mean?"**<br>
And in that moment, I realize… I've entered the danger zone ... He gonna ask me, "Do you know how many type of EvapoTranspiration do we have?"<br>

Well, as scientists, we gonna be series with this. Based on recent papers and books, the physical meaning and difference of terminologies below need to be noticed.
- ETo: Crop Reference EvapoTranspiration.
- ETc: Crop EvapoTranspiration.
- ETa: Actual EvapoTranspiration.
- PET: Potential EvapoTranspiraiton.
