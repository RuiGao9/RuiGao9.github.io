<h2>Eddy-Covariance Flux Trailer (ECFT<sup>+</sup>)</h2>
This project is led by Dr. Safeeq Khan under the CEE department at University of California Merced. I am grateful for the chance to taking part in this ECFT<sup>+</sup> assembling project. I am also grateful for the funding support from the Secure Water Future (USDA NIFA # 2021-69012-35916) and Economic Development Administration Build Back Better Regional Challenge Farms-Food-Future Innovation Iniative (EDA #77907913).<br>
This time, we are targeting at eddy-covariance flux trailer (ECFT<sup>+</sup>), not eddy-covariance flux tower (ECFT).

<h3>ECFT<sup>+</sup> design</h3>
<h4>Step 1 - Assembling a tralier</h4>
We have purchased a tralier online. For more details and stories, Dr. Safeeq Khan can tell you. <br>
Dr. Khan and me assembled the trailer based on the manual. During the assembling, we found that this YouTube video is very helpful to build this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL-F22P8uC8" target="_blank">Haul-Master 5*10 size trailer</a>. 

<h4>Step 2 - ECFT<sup>+</sup> basement design </h4>
Our first design for the ECFT<sup>+</sup> looks like this picture.
