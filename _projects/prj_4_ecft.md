<h2>Eddy-Covariance Flux Trailer (ECFT<sup>+</sup>)</h2>
This project is led by Dr. Safeeq Khan under the CEE department at University of California Merced. I am grateful for the chance to taking part in this ECFT<sup>+</sup> assembling project. I am also grateful for the funding support from the Secure Water Future (USDA NIFA # 2021-69012-35916) and Economic Development Administration Build Back Better Regional Challenge Farms-Food-Future Innovation Iniative (EDA #77907913).<br>
This time, we are targeting at eddy-covariance flux trailer (ECFT<sup>+</sup>), not eddy-covariance flux tower (ECFT).

<h2>ECFT<sup>+</sup> design</h2>
<h3>Step 1 - Assembling a tralier</h3>
We have purchased a tralier online. For more details and stories, Dr. Safeeq Khan can tell you. <br>
Dr. Khan and me assembled the trailer based on the manual. During the assembling, we found that this YouTube video is very helpful to build this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL-F22P8uC8" target="_blank">Haul-Master 5*10 size trailer</a>. <br>
Dr. Khan suggested get the fully developed ECFT<sup>+</sup> layer by layer, which means assembling the trailer at first, then make a "concrete" basement, and then install all the sensors for monitoring.

<h3>Step 2 - ECFT<sup>+</sup> basement design </h3>
We totally have three big components that we need to put them on the trailer: tower, solar panel, and one box for battery and tools. Because of this, our first design for the ECFT<sup>+</sup> looks like this picture.<br>

Dr. Khan spoke with Danny and received more refined suggestions, leading to a few upgrades we need to implement. One key improvement is making the solar panel rotatable, which would allow the trailer to be more adaptable and efficient in capturing solar energy. Another improvement is to install one more box on the trailer to increase capacity and support additional functionalities. Thus, we have this design.

After our hard hand work, we finally get this.

<h3>Step 3 - Installing sensors on the ECFT<sup>+</sup></h3>

<h2>Apogee IRT sensor</h2>
Knowing the land surface temperature can bring us more information, which cannot only help the field work but also improve our research. Thanks for the support from the project, and Dr. Khank ordered one Apogee IRT SI-431 sensor (ultra narrow research gread) for my project. <br>
Once I got it, our target is using CR1000 data logger to talk to the IRT sensor. This is the step one.<br>
Considering that we have already put one LI-COR LI-710 ET sensor working at the field, we are thinking to put this sensor into that system. In our lab, I did a test, just like what is shown here via this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qGr7isubBE" target="_blank">YouTube</a> video. After this test, one important question is how the footprint looks like, and how can we get it?<br> 
This is a very interesting question, and it takes a day for me to build a model published on<a href="https://doi.10.5281/zenodo.15871684" target="_blank">Zenodo</a> to calculate the footprint and generate the footprint with geospatial information. In this case, it can be used for UAV thermal image validation from this IRT sensor, etc. <br>
Meanwhile, given we have the Campbell Scientific EC-Flux tower there, we also considered to put the IRT sensor into that system, too. But this one is not tested so far.

Understanding land surface temperature provides valuable insights that can enhance both fieldwork and our research outcomes. With support from the project, Dr. Khan ordered an Apogee SI-431 infrared radiometer (ultra-narrow, research-grade) specifically for my project.
Once I received the sensor, our first goal was to connect it to a CR1000 data logger—this was our initial step.
Given that we already have a LI-COR LI-710 ET sensor operating in the field, we considered integrating the IRT sensor into the same system. In the lab, I conducted a test, as demonstrated in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qGr7isubBE).
Following the test, a key question emerged: *What does the sensor’s footprint look like, and how can we determine it?* This led to a day-long effort to develop a model—now published on [Zenodo](https://doi.10.5281/zenodo.15871684)—that calculates the sensor’s footprint and outputs geospatially-referenced results. This tool can be used, for example, to validate UAV thermal imagery against data from the IRT sensor.
In parallel, we also explored the possibility of connecting the IRT sensor to our Campbell Scientific eddy covariance (EC) flux tower system. However, this integration has not yet been tested.
