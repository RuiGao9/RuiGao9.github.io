<h2>Eddy-Covariance Flux Trailer (ECFT<sup>+</sup>)</h2>
This project is led by Dr. Safeeq Khan under the CEE department at University of California Merced. I am grateful for the chance to taking part in this ECFT<sup>+</sup> assembling project. I am also grateful for the funding support from the Secure Water Future (USDA NIFA # 2021-69012-35916) and Economic Development Administration Build Back Better Regional Challenge Farms-Food-Future Innovation Iniative (EDA #77907913).<br>
This time, we are targeting at eddy-covariance flux trailer (ECFT<sup>+</sup>), not eddy-covariance flux tower (ECFT).

<h2>ECFT<sup>+</sup> design</h2>
<h3>Step 1 - Assembling a tralier</h3>
We have purchased a tralier online. For more details and stories, Dr. Safeeq Khan can tell you. <br>
Dr. Khan and me assembled the trailer based on the manual. During the assembling, we found that this YouTube video is very helpful to build this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL-F22P8uC8" target="_blank">Haul-Master 5*10 size trailer</a>. <br>
Dr. Khan suggested get the fully developed ECFT<sup>+</sup> layer by layer, which means assembling the trailer at first, then make a "concrete" basement, and then install all the sensors for monitoring.

<h3>Step 2 - ECFT<sup>+</sup> basement design </h3>
We totally have three big components that we need to put them on the trailer: tower, solar panel, and one box for battery and tools. Because of this, our first design for the ECFT<sup>+</sup> looks like this picture.<br>

Dr. Khan spoke with Danny and received more refined suggestions, leading to a few upgrades we need to implement. One key improvement is making the solar panel rotatable, which would allow the trailer to be more adaptable and efficient in capturing solar energy. Another improvement is to install one more box on the trailer to increase capacity and support additional functionalities. Thus, we have this design.

After our hard hand work, we finally get this.

<h3>Step 3 - Installing sensors on the ECFT<sup>+</sup></h3>

<h2>Apogee IRT sensor</h2>
Understanding the change of the land surface temperature provides valuable insights that can enhance both fieldwork and our research outcomes. With support from the project, Dr. Khan ordered an Apogee SI-431 infrared radiometer (ultra-narrow, research-grade) specifically for my project.<br>
Once I received the sensor, our first goal was to connect it to a CR1000 data logger—this was our initial step.<br>
Given that we already have a LI-COR LI-710 ET sensor operating in the field, we considered integrating the IRT sensor into the same system. In the lab, I conducted a test, as demonstrated in this [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qGr7isubBE) video.<br>
Following the test, a key question emerged: *What does the sensor’s footprint look like, and how can we determine it?* This led to a day-long effort to develop a model—now published on [Zenodo](https://doi.10.5281/zenodo.15871684)—that calculates the sensor’s footprint and outputs geospatially-referenced results. This tool can be used, for example, to validate UAV thermal imagery against data from the IRT sensor.<br>
In parallel, we also explored the possibility of connecting the IRT sensor to our Campbell Scientific eddy covariance (EC) flux tower system. However, this integration has not yet been tested.<br>
