<!-- Step 1 - Assembling a tralier<br>
We have purchased a tralier online. For more details and stories, Dr. Safeeq Khan can tell you. <br>
Dr. Khan and me assembled the trailer based on the manual. During the assembling, we found that this YouTube video is very helpful to build this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL-F22P8uC8" target="_blank">Haul-Master 5*10 size trailer</a>. <br>
Dr. Khan suggested get the fully developed ECFT<sup>+</sup> layer by layer, which means assembling the trailer at first, then make a "concrete" basement, and then install all the sensors for monitoring. -->
