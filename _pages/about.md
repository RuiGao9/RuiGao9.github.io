<h2>Welcome to FEWS Lab at UC-Merced!<br>Also WELCOME to follow my research!</h2>
<p>
  Rui is now working at <a href="https://ecohydrology.ucmerced.edu/" target="_blank">FEWS Lab</a> at University of California Merced as a postdoctoral scholar. With the support from local resouces, including his supervisors, he not only continues his interests in EvapoTranspiration (ET) estimation at different spatial scales but also extends his interests in drought, wildfire, air quality, etc.

<h2>About Me.</h2>
<p>
  <img src="/images/AboutMe/GR-Hometown.jpg" alt="Hometown" style="width: 400px; float: right; margin: 5px 5px 5px 10px;">
  I was born in a small town less than 80 miles by road from the border between China and Kazakhstan. My family relocated three times within the same region, but the second place we lived—where about 50 families resided—left the most lasting impression on me. That tight-knit community, where two languages were spoken, was rich in cultural traditions and offered a truly unique and beautiful way of life. You can get a glimpse of its charm from the picture here. I introduced this peaceful place to every friend who visited me, and I’m always eager to share its beauty with more people.<br>
  Imagine this: it’s around 6 a.m., and your mother gently wakes you. Together, you follow the horses and oxen to the open pastures of a breathtaking landscape. Under the soft warmth of the rising sun, you breathe in the crisp morning air, listen to the animals rhythmically chewing fresh grass, and watch them drink from clear, spring-fed streams. Can you imagine how special it would be to share such a moment with your own children?<br>
  The oxen had a mischievous streak. Sometimes, instead of taking the long route home before sunset, they would leap into the river to save time and energy. Even the sharp whistles from the wrangler trying to keep them from crossing couldn’t hold them back. Watching them plunge into the water and paddle determinedly to the other side was pure joy for me as a child—one of those small, unforgettable pleasures that made this place feel truly magical.<br>
  As the first person in my family to step beyond our small community and earn a doctoral degree, I carry these memories with deep pride and gratitude. By sharing my journey—one rooted in a quiet village and shaped by humble beginnings—I hope to inspire my children and others who visit my website to dream boldly, strive higher, and value the importance of preserving a clean, simple environment for future generations. If I could follow this path, I truly believe they can go even further.

  I was lucky to go to college instead of managing sheep in mountain areas or applying for ~40 acre farmland for cropping, which were the original plan by my father.<br>
  In the college, I met five really friendly roommates.<br>

  Rui was born in a small town of about 30 families, where the community speaks two languages and maintains a rich blend of cultural traditions. As the first in his family to achieve a doctoral degree, he hopes to inspire his children and others to pursue higher education based on his limited expierences and stories.

<img src="/images/AboutMe/Dissertation_Flyer_GR.png" alt="Ph.D. Defense" style="width: 250px; float: left; margin: 5px 10px 5px 5px;">
Rui started his Ph.D. program in January 2020 under Dr. <a href="https://engineering.usu.edu/cee/people/faculty/torres-alfonso" target="_blank">Alfonso Torres-Rua</a>'s supervisor at <a href="https://uwrl.usu.edu/" target="_blank">Utah Water Research Laboratory</a> (UWRL) in Utah State University (Logan main campus) and obtained his Ph.D. degree in August 2023.<br>
Rui's dissertation focused on utilizing high-resolution imagery from small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS), combined with eddy-covariance (EC) flux tower data and field labor measurements, to assess plant water status and stress in California vineyards. With a master's degree in hydrology emphasizing watershed-scale processes, he remains passionate about applying both physical and data-driven approaches to tackle real-world environmental challenges across different spatial scales. <b>With science and technology deeply fascinate him, it is the people behind them, their perspectives on the environment, agriculture, and sustainability, that inspire him the most.</b></p>

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

Rui's GitHub personal website is built based on [Michael Rose's work](https://academicpages.github.io/)

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
