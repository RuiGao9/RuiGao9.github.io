Dr. [Mac McKee](https://uwrl.usu.edu/news/main-feed/2019/mac-retires) was the director of Utah Water Resources Laboratory ([UWRL](https://uwrl.usu.edu/)) in Utah State University. Dr. McKee was retired in 2019, when I was in my Ph.D. program. After his retirement, he still worked in the lab for a while. At that time, because of my research program was highly related to his research intersting, I got chances to meet him. During that time period, his research attitude had a big impact on my research and career development. Be honest, the communication between us was not that much. But no people defined that the oral communication is the only one way for communication purpose.
