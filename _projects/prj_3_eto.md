<h2>Water resources</h2>
<p>After moving to the University of California, Merced—closer to the region where I conducted my Ph.D. research—I experienced several scenarios that left a strong impression on me.</p>
<p>One of the most striking was the extreme heat: the highest temperature I’ve felt so far reached 40°C during the summer. Walking through the urban landscape, surrounded by concrete, made the heat feel even more intense—almost like being cooked. Another interesting observation is how quickly dust accumulates. Even just a few hours after washing a car, it's common to find a noticeable layer of dust already settling on it.</p>
<p>From this perspective, I sincerely hope to contribute what I’ve learned to benefit the community—even if it’s just in a small way.</p>

<p>Step 1 - Assembling a tralier<br>
We have purchased a tralier online. For more details and stories, Dr. Safeeq Khan can tell you. <br>
Dr. Khan and me assembled the trailer based on the manual. During the assembling, we found that this YouTube video is very helpful to build this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL-F22P8uC8" target="_blank">Haul-Master 5*10 size trailer</a>.
