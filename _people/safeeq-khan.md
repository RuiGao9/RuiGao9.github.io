    <p>Dr. <a href="https://ecohydrology.ucmerced.edu/" target="_blank">Safeeq Khan</a><br>Associate Professor in CEE Department at University of California Merced.</p> 
    <!-- <p>His personality is very attractive, and you can feel it based on the <a href="https://www.watertalkpodcast.com/episodes/episode-53" target="_blank">conversation</a> below:<br>
    <p>I kind of took a very unusual path. And this is simply because I grew up in a very rural part of India. I had no idea in terms of a research career, or, going abroad, to be honest with you. So, I was basically helping out my family with a lot of the farming activity day to day kind of, making sure that things are taken care of. My dad was a primary school teacher, so he was pretty much always out, and I was the only one at home. So, I was kind of juggling between my own education and taking care of the family.</p> 
    <p>Doing that, I think I had this natural kind of fascination towards nature. Just seeing plants, seeing soil, seeing water kind of flowing in the landscape and that part of India gets flooded quite frequently. So we saw that the flooding was kind of like an adventure. Every year, you wait for the flooding, to get out in the flood and just have fun. And so, I had that natural curiosity. But I would admit that growing up in India, and many kids who grew up in India during my time in the 80s and 90s, we had no luxury of picking your career. We tried our best, and then we just grabbed the opportunity, whatever came our way.</p> 
    <p>So, I basically got, after trying several years for the engineering, I finally got into the Ag Engineering Program, and then tried to make use of that and kind of align my interest what I was fascinated with, and then make that program actually fit. So water came naturally to me. But I was mostly focused towards the on farm type of work. So, you probably don't know this, but my master's thesis was actually looking at earthworm activity in rice fields and how the dual porosity, or microporosity, that earthworms actually create impacts water and solute transport.</p> -->
    <!-- I grew up in a rural part of India, where research and studying abroad were completely outside my world. Most of my time was spent helping my family with farming while balancing school. My father was a primary school teacher and often away, so I had to manage things at home. <br>Spending so much time outdoors, I developed a natural fascination with nature—watching plants grow, feeling the soil, and observing water flow across the landscape. Floods were common where I lived, and as kids, we’d look forward to them as a kind of adventure. <br>I didn’t have the luxury to choose a career freely. After several attempts, I got into an Agricultural Engineering program and gradually aligned my curiosity with academic work. Water felt like a natural focus. For my master’s thesis, I studied how earthworm activity in rice fields—through creating micropores—affects water and solute movement. That hands-on research grounded my passion and set me on the path I’m on today.</p> -->
